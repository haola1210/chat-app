this is just my project to practice everything i've learn.

route dir just used for routing my app as simple as possible

public was the place i stored all of static file of my app

MVC pattern:

views stored all layers and pages of the app, and used PUG template

models stored all schema model of the collection in database. 

controllers stored all main functions of each route of my app.

middleware stored all support functions and advanced functions that had been built by myself

.env was used for keeping all environment variables i set
